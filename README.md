# Cyclistic Bike Sharing Data Analysis

This is a case study completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project.

## About Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company operating in Chicago. The company's executive team is focused on driving growth and is exploring strategies to convert a significant number of casual riders into members.

## Project Overview

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I have been tasked with conducting a comprehensive data analysis to provide insights and recommendations to the executives. This analysis involves exploring, processing, and analyzing relevant data to make data-driven decisions.
